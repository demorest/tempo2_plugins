tempo2_plugins
P. Demorest, NRAO

This is a collection of plugins for the TEMPO2 pulsar timing software
package.  If all your environment variables are set up correctly,
installation should be as simple as 'make && make install'.  This may
transition to something more complex (like autotools) at some point.

The current plugins here are:

mcmc_plug - This plugin runs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) version
of the timing fit.  It was originally developed to characterize Shapriro
delay in J1614-2230 (Demorest et al. 2010).  The chain is output is to a
fits table that can then be read and analyzed with for example
python/pyfits as appropriate.

grid_plug - This one calculates a chi2 grid for a specified range of the
M2 and SINI Shapiro delay parameters.  At each grid point, M2 and SINI
are held fixed and any other flagged parameters are fit for.

resid_plug - This outputs residuals and some other useful info in a
simple ASCII format (same as 'print_resid').
